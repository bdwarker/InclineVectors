# InclineVectors 

---

This Python program is an **interactive physics visualization** that shows how a force applied to an object on an inclined plane can be broken down into its **parallel** and **normal** components.  
It also simulates **gravity**, **friction**, and **object motion** along the slope, letting you explore the effects of applied forces in real time.

## üéØ Features

- **Interactive Force Application**  
  Click and drag on the object to apply a force. The program will:
  - Draw the **applied force vector**.
  - Decompose it into **parallel** and **normal** components relative to the slope.
  - Remove the vectors when the mouse is released.

- **Gravity & Friction Simulation**  
  The object naturally slides down the incline due to gravity, with friction opposing motion.

- **Adjustable Incline Angle**  
  Change the slope from flat to steep using keyboard controls.

- **Change Object Shape**  
  Switch between a **rectangle** and a **circle** while keeping it aligned with the slope.

- **Physics Accuracy**  
  Forces and accelerations are computed according to the slope angle, gravity, and friction.

## üì∑ Example

When you drag the mouse from the object:
- **Red vector**: Applied Force
- **Green vector**: Parallel Component (along the slope)
- **Blue vector**: Normal Component (into the slope)
- **Yellow vector**: Gravity
